# Life expectancy predictor
## Co-authors: sianbrady17, Saka1111, MustafaCh1
This repo contains 4 files.
## 1. EDA
The first file takes WHO data from a csv and investigates the nature of the data and its suitability for linear regression predicting life expectancy.
## 2. Feature_engineering
The second file takes WHO data from a csv and prepares it for linear regression, including scaling. P-value selection and VIF checks are used to ensure variables are appropriate for inclusion. It saves the required data into 6 csv's in the current working directory, splitting the data by train/test, predictors/predicted and a stricter selection of predictors for a second model.
## 3. Model
The third file takes csv data generated by Feature_engineering and creates two linear regression models, with relevant metrics. A ridge model verifies results by checking the stats and metrics: R^2, Condition Number and RMSE, using a different method and scaler.
## 4. Life_expectancy_predcitor
The fourth file takes the coefficients from the model and minmax range from the training data in order to construct an autonomous function which can be called to predict life expectancy (requires importing numpy and sys depending on IDE). There is some input validation and warnings which trigger when data is entered beyond the training range (requiring rescaling).
