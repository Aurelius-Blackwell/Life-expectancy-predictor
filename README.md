# Life expectancy predictor
## Co-authors: sianbrady17, Saka1111, MustafaCh1
This repo contains 4 files.
## 1. EDA
This file takes WHO data from a csv and investigates the nature of the data and its suitability for linear regression predicting life expectancy.
## 2. Feature_engineering
This file takes WHO data from a csv and prepares it for linear regression, including scaling. P-value selection and VIF checks are used to ensure variables are appropriate for inclusion. It saves the requires data into 6 csv's, splitting the data by train/test, predictors/predicted and a stricter selection of predictors for a second model.
## Model
This file takes csv data generated by Feature_engineering and creates two linear regression models, with relevant metrics. A ridge model verifies results by checking the stats and metrics: R^2, Condition Number and RMSE, using a different method and scaler.
## Life_expectancy_predcitor
This file takes the coefficients from the model and minmax range from the training data in order to construct a function which can be called to predict life expectancy. There is some input validation and warnings which trigger when data is entered beyond the training range (requiring rescaling).
